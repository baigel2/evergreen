# Day 9: Friday 16th May 2025

Time: 18.40
Balance: -Â£713.39

I've missed a whole week of updates! Shizer :/


Some things I'm working on and have done:


* Well I've started a new series on the blog. The origin of music. It's still a draft but you can view it [here](www.baigelbytes.com/blog/originmusic)
* I'll add cross links to my homepages in lsrp and evergreen (which I will sometimes shorten to evg because I'm lazy).
* My ESTA has been approved so I'm officially going to USA in November.

I'll try and be more consistent with journal entries moving forward.

Month 2 rules will not be spartan goggins mode which I was thinking of doing. So far I've thought of the following:

1. One takeaway a month.
2. One purchase from each type of junk food for the month.
3. Challenge; Go one week without spending a penny. Whichever week you like.
4. No snacks.
5. No major purchases.
6. Stick to your budget!

This will be from the 5th of june to the 5th of July.


Month 1's rules I will be carrying over are:

* Gym 3 times a week.
* 100% of all Salah.
