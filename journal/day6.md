# Day 6: 10.05.2025: Saturday:

* Time: 19:12
* Balance: -Â£670.55
* Entry:

I've had a few day off now and I'm starting to feel better but the virus or whatever it is is still there. I'm going to skip the last gym session of the week and start fresh on monday with a light session.

I need somethig other than my prepped meals to eat so I'm going to go to the shop to search for some meat.
