Entry:

I don't want to go to the gym today. I really don't want to go to the gym today.

I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the idea of going to the gym today!!

Also don't want to go for a cold shower.

Then again, that's why they call it a fucking challenge isn't it.

 * Update 16:06: Arrived at gym.

Almost bought a protein bar from the gym vending machine then remembered the £0.00 food spend challenge.

* Update 18:10: Done!
