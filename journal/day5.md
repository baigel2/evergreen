# Day 5: 09.05.2025: Friday:

* Time: 11:12
* Balance: -£643.35
* Entry:

I think I'm going too hard at the gym so not going today but tomorrow instead.
Also might noght do the squats on gym days. Yesterday was almost fainting and now I feel ill, sore throat and stuff.

I could go Goggins mode and just not give a fuck, but I want to still be productive in other areas of life and actually enjoy life a bit too.

I transfered £50 to another monzo pot for taxi fares for my operation.

Need to book time off work for it.
