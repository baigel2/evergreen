# Evergreen

A project to establish sustainable, adaptable, life long discipline.

I lack Discipline. FInancial discipline. Emotional discipline. Dietary discipline. I miss my prayers sometimes. I get up late and just barely make it to work on time sometimes. Every month I end up at the bottom of my overdraft. I'm 34 years old with nothing to show for it. Bruce Lee died at 32!

But perhaps I can turn this failure of a life into something meaningful. Perhaps I can, by the time I die, have had a net positive impact.

First, I need discipline.

## Discipline 100:

Towards the end of 2023 I gave myself a challenge. 100 Days of discipline. No junk food of any kind, no takeaways, cold showers as little sleep as possible, as many pushups a day as possible.

I was trying to push myself as hard as possible see where my limits were. I found them.

As I allowed myself less and less sleep it afected me. My caffine intake went up and up and it helped less and less. For a while I was even taking caffinated chewing gum everyday as well as coffee.

Though I was doing at least 100 push ups a day I actually got weaker. Though I was not eating junk food I was still eating healthy food constantly so I didn't actually lose weight and even though I got better at push ups I actually got phisically weaker overall.

I did achieve some things though. Or at least begin to achieve some things.

I started learning how to draw animal portraits. I restarted my blog. I started writing 3 books simultaneously.

I was trying to learn 12 languages simultaneously. As you can guess I ended up learning none as nothing was actually sticking in my head.

I found out where my limits were and that, although I could push myself past them, that wouldn't always lead to more productivity, efficiency or a necasserily improved life. Also, I didn't like the way it made me treat people.

With little sleep (sometimes 4hrs, sometimes even less) I was quick to frustration and anger and when I saw how simple (but not easy) it was to make progress in my life and how little effort some of my loved ones were putting in to improving their lives while at the same time complaining about it, I tried to encourage them to make more of an effort.

Or at least that's what I thought I was doing.

Goggins mode is most definitely not for everyone. Turns out, it's really not for me either.

But from every failure, we can learn something, and if you learn from a failure it turns into a lesson and a lesson well learned is a step forwards not back. So...

# Enter Evergreen:

The Evergreen Project has one aim. Progress. Sustainable, life long progress.

A set of systems I can improve upon for the rest of my life that will help me to improve myself and therefore my life and the lives of those around me.

The first step is establishing the foundations. What are those?

## Dicipline.

Yes I know. It's the word no one wants to hear but it's not something any succesful person can afford to live without and it's about time I adopted it for good.

With this project I will find out, through experimentation, trial and error, how to create life long, sustainable, reliable discipline.

For this purpose I will create a rolling discipline challenge. From payday to payday I will set rules and restrictions and then review their success and failures each month.

Sometimes, the joy of the journey is as good as the win.
