A project to establish sustainable, adaptable, life long discipline.

I lack Discipline. FInancial discipline. Emotional discipline. Dietary discipline. I miss my prayers sometimes. I get up late and just barely make it to work on time sometimes. Every month I end up at the bottom of my overdraft. I'm 34 years old with nothing to show for it. Bruce Lee died at 32!

But perhaps I can turn this failure of a life into something meaningful. Perhaps I can, by the time I die, have had a net positive impact.

First, I need discipline.

## Intensity vs Consistency.
