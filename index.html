<p>What the hell is this?:</p>
<h1 id="evergreen">Evergreen</h1>
<p>A project to establish sustainable, adaptable, life long
discipline.</p>
<p>I lack Discipline. FInancial discipline. Emotional discipline.
Dietary discipline. I miss my prayers sometimes. I get up late and just
barely make it to work on time sometimes. Every month I end up at the
bottom of my overdraft. I’m 34 years old with nothing to show for it.
Bruce Lee died at 32!</p>
<p>But perhaps I can turn this failure of a life into something
meaningful. Perhaps I can, by the time I die, have had a net positive
impact.</p>
<p>First, I need discipline.</p>
<h2 id="discipline-100">Discipline 100:</h2>
<p>Towards the end of 2023 I gave myself a challenge. 100 Days of
discipline. No junk food of any kind, no takeaways, cold showers as
little sleep as possible, as many pushups a day as possible.</p>
<p>I was trying to push myself as hard as possible see where my limits
were. I found them.</p>
<p>As I allowed myself less and less sleep it afected me. My caffine
intake went up and up and it helped less and less. For a while I was
even taking caffinated chewing gum everyday as well as coffee.</p>
<p>Though I was doing at least 100 push ups a day I actually got weaker.
Though I was not eating junk food I was still eating healthy food
constantly so I didn’t actually lose weight and even though I got better
at push ups I actually got phisically weaker overall.</p>
<p>I did achieve some things though. Or at least begin to achieve some
things.</p>
<p>I started learning how to draw animal portraits. I restarted my blog.
I started writing 3 books simultaneously.</p>
<p>I was trying to learn 12 languages simultaneously. As you can guess I
ended up learning none as nothing was actually sticking in my head.</p>
<p>I found out where my limits were and that, although I could push
myself past them, that wouldn’t always lead to more productivity,
efficiency or a necasserily improved life. Also, I didn’t like the way
it made me treat people.</p>
<p>With little sleep (sometimes 4hrs, sometimes even less) I was quick
to frustration and anger and when I saw how simple (but not easy) it was
to make progress in my life and how little effort some of my loved ones
were putting in to improving their lives while at the same time
complaining about it, I tried to encourage them to make more of an
effort.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s what I thought I was doing.</p>
<p>Goggins mode is most definitely not for everyone. Turns out, it’s
really not for me either.</p>
<p>But from every failure, we can learn something, and if you learn from
a failure it turns into a lesson and a lesson well learned is a step
forwards not back. So…</p>
<h1 id="enter-evergreen">Enter Evergreen:</h1>
<p>The Evergreen Project has one aim. Progress. Sustainable, life long
progress.</p>
<p>A set of systems I can improve upon for the rest of my life that will
help me to improve myself and therefore my life and the lives of those
around me.</p>
<p>The first step is establishing the foundations. What are those?</p>
<h2 id="dicipline.">Dicipline.</h2>
<p>Yes I know. It’s the word no one wants to hear but it’s not something
any succesful person can afford to live without and it’s about time I
adopted it for good.</p>
<p>With this project I will find out, through experimentation, trial and
error, how to create life long, sustainable, reliable discipline.</p>
<p>For this purpose I will create a rolling discipline challenge. From
payday to payday I will set rules and restrictions and then review their
success and failures each month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the joy of the journey is as good as the win.</p>
<h2 id="balance.">Balance.</h2>
<p>It’s 100% worth noting that when I say discipline I do not mean it in
the same sense that David Goggins does.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to push myself past my limits everyday, I’m trying to
raise my baseline performance gradually and sustainably accross as many
metrics as I can manage.</p>
<p>I will therefore focus on the essentials. Diet, Finances, Income
Sources Faith, Family and Fittness.</p>
